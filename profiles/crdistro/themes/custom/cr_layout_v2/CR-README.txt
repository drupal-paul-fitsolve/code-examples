CR Layout V2 is based on OHM, an OMEGA V4 sub theme. It uses 
bootstrap and requires that you have set this up locally.

The theme itself is fairly bare bones. There are two templates, 

### 1. CR Responsive Template ###
This is an omega layout for the header and footer. It should be 
overriden by any sub theme to make it work for that sub site.

### 2. CR Content ###
The panels template providing eight rows to work with. This can 
and may be extended to provide additional rows or functionality.

### 3. Base Theme, OMEGA V4 ###
The theme is using Omega V4 as a base theme. I would suggest you 
read up further on how omega works and it's benefits by reading 
or watching any of these tutorials:
