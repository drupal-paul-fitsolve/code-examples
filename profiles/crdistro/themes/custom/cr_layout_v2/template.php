 *  - Go to admin/appearance/settings/<theme>
 *  - Open the 'Asstes' tab
 *  - Select 'Enable Assets extension'
 *  - Scroll down. Select 'Modernizr'
 *  - Save
 *
 * In general, Modernizr should only be enabled in cr_layout_v2 sub-themes.
 *
 * Testing:
 *
 * There are various ways to test Modernizr is being included:
 *
 *  - Check the following script is being added to <head> scripts section
 *    - /sites/all/themes/custom/cr_layout_v2/libraries/modernizr/modernizr.min.js
 *
 *  - Inspect the body element. You should see a lot of classes added, based on the capabilities
 *    of your browser. Ie. csstransitions, svg, flexbox etc
 *
 *  - In a console window, the Modernizr object shoud be available
 *
