Auto height Needs a couple of things set up to work properly

1. Ensure that there is only either one panel or two panels assigned to the region
2. Apply the auto height region style
 - For one panel choose 100%
 - For two panels choose either 60/40 or vice versa
3. Added a Semantic outer wrapper around the panel using div. Just add the default classes
