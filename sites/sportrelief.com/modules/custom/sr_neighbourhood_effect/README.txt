This is a quick custom module with an admin page.  It adds a piece of javascript to a page using drupal_add_js checking permissions first.  The admin page also allows for changing that URL and disabling/enabling this functionality.

Liz Curry is owning this requirement, and it is a part of a door drop experiment, so the stats are important for this.
