  <p>You have clicked on the link that will remove your name from the list of donations we will be submitting to HM Revenue &amp; Customs to claim Gift Aid. If for any reason you didn't intend us to remove your name - perhaps you clicked on the link in error - or if you wish to contact us about Gift Aid on your donation, please email us at <a class="ga-link" href="mailto:giftaid@comicrelief.com">giftaid@comicrelief.com</a>.</p>

  <p>Even though we won't now be claiming Gift Aid, we're grateful for your original donation, which will help change the lives of people both here in the UK and around the world.</p>

  <p>Thank you again.</p>
